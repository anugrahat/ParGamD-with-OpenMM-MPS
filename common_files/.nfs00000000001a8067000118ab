Module conda3/4.X loaded.

This module initializes a base conda install in your current shell environment.
It takes care of `conda init`, and as such, will interfere with locally-installed 
conda; if you have a local install, it should have warned you and failed to load.

To view available environments, including your local environments and those 
installed system-wide, use: 

    conda env list

To activate an environment, use: 

    conda activate [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]

To create your own environment, you can use either the `conda` or `mamba` command.
`mamba` functions exactly the same as `conda`, and uses the same channels, while 
solving and creating environments much more efficiently. For example, you could create 
an environment containing python v3.10, pandas, and ipython with: 

    mamba create -n my-pandas-env python=3.10 pandas ipython

and activate it with `conda activate my-pandas-env`.
